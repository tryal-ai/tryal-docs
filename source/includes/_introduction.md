# Introduction

Welcome to the Tryal.AI Developer API! We're glad you've chosen to use Tryal.AI as
your Question and Examinations as a Service provider (QEaaS). Tryal.AI's API lets
you use our state-of-the-art AI system to generate Maths practice material, at both
the question, and examination level.

As Tryal.AI is a non-deterministic AI based generation system, results are not guaranteed
nor predictable. To help alleviate this, we'll provide key information and useful advice
on how to achieve the results you're looking for when making a request to one of our generation
systems.

<aside class="notice">
  Tryal.AI is not strictly non-deterministic, but most of our generation services are non-deterministic 
  by default.

All calls which consume your subscription's usage plan are clearly highlighted, with in-depth explanations
provided on when, how, and what quantity we will bill.
