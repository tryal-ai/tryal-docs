# Manage API

Our Tryal.AI Manage API is provided as a way for you to see your billing and get information useful to yourself and your application. As we develop out our API further, we'd love to hear what aspects you'd like to be able to control of Tryal.AI remotely.

For now the manage API allows you to access your usage via [<span class="get">get</span> /usage](#get-usage).
